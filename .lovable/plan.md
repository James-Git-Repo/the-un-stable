## Update GenieLink Cover Image

### What needs to change

The GenieLink cover image (`src/assets/cover-genielink.jpg`) needs to be regenerated to:

1. **Match the visual style of the other two covers**: dark brown/black background with orange monoline line-art illustrations (same palette and technique as the Newsletter and AI Billboard covers)
2. **Feature a genie lamp** as the central element on the homepage card
3. The same image will also be used as the hero banner on the `/genielink` intermediate page

### Image generation prompt

The AI image will be generated with a prompt targeting:
- Dark brown/charcoal background (matching hex tones from the other covers)
- Orange outline-only illustration style (no fills, thin strokes)
- Central genie lamp with digital/link elements emanating from it (chains, link icons, connected nodes)
- Landscape aspect ratio matching the other covers

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/assets/cover-genielink.jpg` | Regenerated with genie lamp in dark + orange line-art style |

No code changes needed -- only the image asset is replaced.
